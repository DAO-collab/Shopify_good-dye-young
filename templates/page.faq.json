            "title": "Step by step guide to lighten your hair using GDY Lightening Kit",
            "text": "<p>The very best way to apply a lightener to  hair is as follows:<\/p><p>1. Do a strand test to make sure your hair can take a lightener and also a patch test if you plan on applying the GDY Lightening Kit to your scalp.<br\/><br\/>2. Section and clip your hair into 4 sections by parting your hair down the middle and then side to side from top of crown to bottom of ear.<br\/><br\/>3. Start with the bottom sections first and apply GDY Lightening Kit away from the root area. The bottom of your hair is usually darker and more stubborn, that’s why you want to start there. <em><strong>TIP: <\/strong><\/em><em>Did you know that the heat from the scalp will make the Lightener swell, and it will process much more quickly at the root due to the heat from the scalp?  Hold off on applying the root area AFTER you are done processing the rest of your hair if you want to avoid hot roots.<br\/><br\/><\/em>4. Methodically apply the GDY Lightener mixture in small sections, remembering to leave the roots out. If you take too thick of sections, you may miss spots, and end up with a splotchy base. Saturate the strand of hair by working the GDY Lightening Kit evenly into each section with a gloved hand  <em><strong>TIP<\/strong><\/em><em>: If the ends of your hair are lighter naturally, leave them out for now until after you have applied the Lightening Kit to all the sections. Then go back and apply the Lightener to the ends. This will help prevent the ends of your hair from over processing ( aka: turning to mush).<br\/><br\/><\/em>5. Once you apply your lightener to the mids and ends of your hair, go back through each section and apply the lightener to your roots.<br\/><br\/>6. A good idea is to wrap each strand into tinfoil to help the Lightener lift faster and keep it from drying out. When Lightener dries out, it quits working. <em><strong>TIP<\/strong><\/em><em>: If you do not have tinfoil, after you finish each quadrant, wrap it in plastic wrap. After you have completed the application, wrap your entire hair with plastic wrap.<br\/><br\/><\/em>7. Let your hair process for no more than 50 minutes, until you achieve the desired tone. Check consistently (every 5-10 minutes) to evaluate the color lift. (Darker hair may need to be lightened more than once to reach your perfect base.)<br\/><br\/>8. After you have achieved the desired result, rinse the Lightener out thoroughly and shampoo. <em><strong>TIP<\/strong><\/em><em>: If you plan on using a semi-permanent dye afterwards, do not condition! Conditioner coats the hair cuticle and prevents the color from taking as well as it could.<br\/><br\/><\/em>9. Now you can apply your favorite GDY hair color!<\/p>"

Do not add peroxide or other permanent hair colorants.<br\/>GDY hair colorants may temporarily stain skin and permanently stain the fabric of clothes, towels and bedding etc., so be careful when applying!<br\/>Do not use with alkaline-based products as these will upset the pH balance needed for maximum absorption of color by the hair. Low pH or non-alcohol hair products are recommended.<br\/>Not for internal use, DO NOT INGEST. Keep out of the reach of small children.<br\/>For the best results, please use on porous, bleached, tinted or naturally light blonde hair.When applied to darker untreated hair, results may vary depending on hair shade and texture.<br\/>Protect your skin from staining by applying shea butter, coconut oil, or thick hair conditioner to your hairline and over the ears.If you get a little GDY on your skin, try rubbing toothpaste or baking soda paste (baking soda mixed with a little bit of water) onto the stain with a toothbrush and gently scrub in circular motions.<br\/>Remember to keep your GDY color out of direct sunlight and in a cool, dry place. Direct sunlight or extreme heat can cause them to fade and change color.<\/p>"

If staining occurs, try using a baking soda paste or toothpaste to remove the stain.<br\/>• Wear old clothes and use a towel that you don’t mind staining.Place newspaper or towels around where you’re dyeing to protect surfaces from staining.<br\/>• Use mirrors both in front and behind you when applying GDY hair dye. If you are doing it yourself this will help you not miss any spots!<br\/>• Rinse your hair in the sink rather than the shower to avoid staining surfaces such as your bathtub.<br\/>• Always use cold water when rinsing out GDY hair dye.<br\/>• It’s recommended you don’t wash your hair with shampoo or conditioner for at least a week after dyeing.<\/p>"
